    Controlling Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) in underwater environments is challenging 
    due to their nonlinear and unpredictable nature. This thesis explores enhancing sliding 
    mode control (SMC) for ROVs using convex optimization to improve stability and 
    performance while reducing chattering.
    A comprehensive mathematical model of an ROV is developed, addressing dynamic and 
    kinematic properties along with environmental uncertainties. An optimized SMC scheme 
    is designed, integrating convex optimization to adjust control parameters dynamically, 
    thus minimizing chattering and enhancing robustness.
    Validation through simulations and experiments demonstrates significant improvements 
    in trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. The enhanced SMC scheme proves effective 
    in simulation, confirming its practical applicability.
    This research advances underwater robotics by providing a robust control strategy 
    that enhances ROV stability and efficiency, supporting complex underwater missions 
    like pipeline inspection and environmental monitoring.
