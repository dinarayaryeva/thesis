## **Challenges in Underwater Vehicle Control**

1. **Complex Hydrodynamics**\
Underwater vehicles operate in a fluid environment with complex hydrodynamic forces that are difficult to model accurately.

2. **Nonlinear Dynamics**\
Underwater vehicles exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics, with coupled motions and significant cross-coupling effects.

3. **Disturbance Rejection**\
Underwater vehicles must contend with external disturbances such as ocean currents, waves, and unexpected obstacles.


<!-- ## Rationale for Underwater Vehicle Control -->
<!-- ## Literature review -->

## **Rationale for Underwater Vehicle Control**

The control of ROVs is challenging due to the nonlinear and unpredictable nature of underwater environments.

Sliding Mode Control (SMC) offers robustness against such uncertainties but is often hindered by chattering, which can cause wear and tear on mechanical components and reduce control accuracy.

Enhancing SMC with convex optimization aims to address these limitations, providing a more stable and precise control mechanism for ROVs.

## **Research Objectives**:

### 1. Develop a comprehensive mathematical model for ROVs.

### 2. Design an SMC scheme enhanced by convex optimization.

### 3. Evaluate the performance through simulation.


## **Mathematical Modelling**

- Single rigid body with 6 DOF. \
Use quaternions for orientation.

- Kinematics and Dynamics:
$$\dot{\bar{r}}^N=J(\bar{r}^N) \bar{v}^B$$
$$M \dot{\bar{v}}^B + C(\bar{v}^B) \bar{v}^B+D(\bar{v}^B) \bar{v}^B+g(\bar{r}^N)= \bar{f}^B$$

- Thrusters Modelling:
$$\bar{f}^B=T\phi(u)$$

## **Inverse Dynamics**

- Approximated system dynamics and thruster mapping:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&M \dot{v} + h(r, v) + \delta = B\nu \\
&\bar{f}^B = T(k\phi_0(u)) = B\phi_0(u) = B\nu
\end{aligned}
$$
- Control law:
$$\nu = \hat{B}^{+}(\hat{M}a + \hat{h}(r, v))$$
- Outer loop control:
$$a = \dot{v}_{des} - K_p \tilde{r} - K_d \tilde{v}$$

## **Sliding Mode**

- Sliding Surface Design:
$$s(r, t) = (\frac{d}{dt} + \lambda)^{n-1}\tilde{{r}}$$
- Sliding Condition: 
$$s^T\dot{s} < - \eta \|s\|$$
- Control Law Design:
$$
\begin{align*} 
    &\nu = \hat{B}^{+}(\hat{M}(a_n + a_s) + \hat h(r, v)) \\
    &a_n = - K_p\tilde{r} - K_d\tilde{v} \\
    &a_s = 
    \begin{cases}
    \rho \frac{s}{\|s\|}, \quad \|s\| > \epsilon\\
    \rho \frac{s}{\epsilon}, \quad \|s\| \leq \epsilon

    \textrm{s.t.} \quad & s^TKa_s \geq \eta \|s\| + \|s\|\|w\| \\\
    & \hat Ma_s - \hat B\nu = -(\hat{M}a_n + h(r, v))
\end{aligned}
$$

\begin{aligned}
    \min_{a_s, \nu, d} \quad & a_s^T R_a a_s  + \nu^T R_{\nu} \nu +

the z direction and some stabilization oscillations.

## **Position Tracking Performance (SM)**
